<h1>About This Project</h1> 
The goal of this project was to create a contemporary web developer portfolio that stands out. Hosting my top projects showcasing my frontend development skills, it also provides various ways for visitors to reach out to me. Incorporating animations such as fading and sliding elements, along with text with a typing animation, added an engaging touch. It was an enjoyable experience bringing this portfolio to life!
